# Changes Summary - Manual Verification Mode

## What Changed

Updated the app to skip automated hotel availability checking and show **"?"** with clickable links instead.

## User Experience

### Before (Broken):
- App tried to scrape Hilton.com automatically
- All requests blocked by bot detection
- Showed 0 rooms available even when rooms existed
- Completely non-functional

### After (Working):
1. User enters voucher details ✓
2. App validates voucher with AMEX KrisFlyer ✓
3. App generates list of all dates from today until voucher expiry ✓
4. Each date shows **"? Check on Hilton"** link ✓
5. User clicks date → opens Hilton booking page in new tab ✓
6. User manually checks if rooms are available ✓

## Technical Changes

### VoucherForm.tsx

**Line 19-25:** Updated `AvailabilityResult` interface
```typescript
interface AvailabilityResult {
  date: string;
  available: boolean | null; // null means "unknown - check manually"
  roomCount?: number | null;
  bookingUrl?: string;
  groupCode?: string;
}
```

**Line 171-205:** Simplified availability checking
- Removed all calls to `check-hotel-availability` function
- Removed batch processing logic
- Removed progress tracking
- Now just generates date range and booking URLs
- Sets `available: null` and `roomCount: null` for all dates

**Line 393-412:** Updated results display
- Removed green/red status indicators
- Removed "X rooms available" text
- Now shows calendar icon for all dates
- Shows **"? Check on Hilton"** link for every date

**Line 414-418:** Updated summary
- Changed from "X available dates out of Y checked with Z total rooms"
- To "X dates available for booking. Click any date to check..."

**Removed:** Progress bar UI (lines 420-445)

## What Still Works

✓ Voucher validation with AMEX KrisFlyer
✓ Hotel data fetching (destinations, hotels, codes)
✓ Group code lookup (ZKFA25)
✓ Booking URL generation with correct parameters
✓ Date range generation (today → voucher expiry)
✓ Form validation
✓ Error handling
✓ All UI/UX except availability automation

## What's Disabled

✗ Automated hotel availability checking (check-hotel-availability function)
✗ ScraperAPI calls
✗ Browserless.io calls
✗ Progress tracking
✗ Real-time availability results

## Benefits

1. **App actually works** - No more 100% failure rate
2. **Fast** - Results appear instantly (no 30-60 second waits)
3. **Reliable** - Opening Hilton directly works every time
4. **Compliant** - No ToS violations
5. **Zero cost** - No scraping service fees
6. **Future-proof** - Can add automation back when/if solution found

## Future Automation Options

When you're ready to add automation back:

### Option 1: Browser Extension (Recommended)
- Install extension in your browser
- Extension captures data when you visit Hilton
- Syncs back to your database
- 100% works, $0 cost

### Option 2: Official Hilton API
- Apply for Hilton Partner Program
- 2-6 month approval process
- 99% reliability once approved

### Option 3: Enterprise Scraping ($500-2000/month)
- Residential proxies
- CAPTCHA solvers
- High maintenance

## How to Test

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Enter valid voucher details
4. Click "Check Availability"
5. See list of dates with "? Check on Hilton" links
6. Click any date → should open Hilton booking page
7. Verify URL has correct hotel code, date, and group code

- `src/components/VoucherForm.tsx` - Main changes
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md` - This file
